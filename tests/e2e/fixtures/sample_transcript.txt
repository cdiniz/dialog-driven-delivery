Meeting: Task Dashboard Feature
Attendees: PM, Dev Lead

PM: We need a task dashboard where users can view and manage their tasks. Users should see tasks in a list, filter by status, and mark tasks complete.

Dev Lead: We'll need a REST API. Should we use PostgreSQL or MongoDB?
PM: Let's decide later. For now, focus on the user experience.

PM: Tasks have a title, description, due date, and assignee. Target users are project managers and team members.

Dev Lead: What about priority levels?
PM: Good question - let's figure that out later.

PM: Success metric: 80% of users check dashboard daily within first month.
