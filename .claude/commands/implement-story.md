description: Orchestrate the implementation of a user story
---

1. Ask the user for the user story file path (e.g., docs/feature-name/story-01-title.md)
2. Read the story file and the feature spec (docs/feature-name/spec.md)
3. Make an implementation plan for the story using the feature spec as context
4. Create a branch with the story name and execute implementation plan
5. Update story status to `in_progress` in frontmatter at start, and `done` when complete
