Meeting: About Page Planning
PM: We need a static about page showing the company name and a short description.
Dev: Should we pull that content from the CMS or hardcode it?
PM: Not sure yet, let's decide later. For now just plan for both options.
Designer: Do we need a hero image or banner at the top?
PM: Good question — I'll check with marketing and get back to you.
Dev: What about mobile responsiveness? Same layout or simplified?
PM: Same layout should be fine, but let's confirm with the design team.
Dev: If we use the CMS we'll need to hook into the existing Contentful client.
Dev: Either way we should have an integration test for the fetch and a unit test for the static fallback.
PM: We haven't defined success metrics or the user journey yet — that's for a follow-up.
